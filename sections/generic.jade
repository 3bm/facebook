  h3.note Note: This is an unreleased in development project. If you get this link is because I know you directly, please don't share it yet because is incomplete. I'm looking for feedback, suggestions and I'm sure if you had this link is because you can provide valuable insight on this issue ;) Thanks

block what

  p The filter bubble is a social problem, not a personal problem. The effect is in the massess misinformation, and only with a collective effort we can measure it, understand it, resist against it.

  p The filter bubble is personal and subjective: you can't see it on your own because you're inside. Also, if you put attention on it, you'll probably have the knowledge to escape. Comparing your filter bubble with the multiture of user, we can understand the logic behind Facebook penalizing or promoting content.

  p Censoring content is much easier with algorithm than takedown: if a content get removed, it is clear to everybody. If a content get heavily penalized in the bubble logic, is "the Algorithm fault":
    b the perfect tecnocratic scapegoat.
    | In such case is nobody guilt. This project will act as a third party able to see how much content get faily seen by users.

  p Joining facebook.tracking.exposed, you can extract the meta-data of what Facebook is giving to you, and thus an open community of researchers can
    b  analyze algorithm outcomes and keep Facebook accountable.
  | It would be hard, but is a beginning.

  p Done! if something is not working, tap here to get more support (TODO)

  p Now, when you open the Facebook page (only in the browser in which you put the tools above, not in the mobile app), you will send non-sensitive metadata to the project servers; You will have access to a personal page showing how Facebook messed up with your information order. 
    b. TODO: Show some icon.


block vision

  p Researchers can use the API to research on the Filter Bubble, 
    b No payment access will be ever demanded
    | , but considering we are challenging one of the wealthiest concept of the last decades, we've to deal distributing the effort in cooperation.

  p Structures with money can run their own server and offload mine. I want make public resource of what can be considered one of the secret power of this Internet world; If you partecipate in the network, you will not have any special benefit beside knowing how much Facebook has tampered your timeline. If you support with a server, you will just have a faster access for conducting research.

  p No private content are collected. No harm can be done do your facebook account by facebook. 
    b You are not violating the Term of Service
    | , and this technology is not using the Facebook API. Is only extracting metadata (what|when|where|why) of what you see in your timeline. Then researches can look for patterns, and you will get some stats (page still in TODO)

  p New developers can contribute on extracting more meta-data from the Facebook page. Scraping can be more reliable, look at the: 
    a(href="https://github.com/vecna/ESCVI") browser-side technology
    |.
  p.smaller Please note, I wish to pay developers, researcher and advocate. But this project is zero-funded right now. Maybe I'll try crowfunding in the future, if someone want to think about it, I'll provide Open Data on how the project is doing.
  p Advocate, Journalist and Technimagician: I want localize these pages and leverage on local troubles to promote the tech, for example, from US you'll see this page that instead of raising the abstract problem of the Filter Bubble, raising the queston if Facebook is promoting Trump or Clinton (TODO). Every nation can be covered in the same way, tap here (TODO) to tell me about new political declinations.
  p Algorithms has to be explained and not treated as dark magic. Which are the variables considered? what weights more in the final outcome? Algorithm discrimination will be an huge topic, and having ways to be understood by non-technical audience is necessary considering that algoritm impact on everyone.

  p Filter Bubble is more a social issue than a personal issue: you can spend effort in escaping, and actively keep in mind that it exist, but this is a minority questioning what they are perceiveing. 
  P The society is undefended against an entity that can influence our learning process, so
  p What I want: having only chronological unfiltered content. The decision of which algorithms, visualisation, correlation, suggestions and meta-data will happen on the client side. User choice.
