    The filter bubble is a virtual cage for your immagination

  p.
    The filter bubble is personal and subjective: you can't see it on your own, you need to compare it with others, to understand what Facebook is penalizing and promoting

  p.
    This project is a collective experiment, as network users we can extract meta-data of what Facebook is doing to us, and reverse their algorithm.

    Invite new developers to contribute on the a(href="https://github.com/vecna/ESCVI") browser-side technology. 
    I've to parse Facebook page, we can extract much more metadata to increase the analysis capability of the project

  p.
    I want to pay developers, researcher and advocate. But I've not money do to it, so I'll do a crowfunding campaign and a call for developers that can do some tasks.

  p.
    Reserch center are invited to run their own server, that can share data with mine, and they can offer resiliance, redundancy to the network, and keep my small server not overloaded. Contact me, we'll figure out some traffic balancing strategy.

    The harsh truth

  p.
    I've a certain value in the IT market, but IT market most of the time exploit Rights or humans condition
  p.
    Find a politically sustainable way to manage users data, see the limit of centralisation without the Silicon Valley mind and challenge the network monopolies costs time and experience
  p.
    I've not the capacity to look for funding, because I'm mostly a tecnician, so, if you believe in this project, left a tip here

      Despite I've shared above my Twitter account, I don't want endorse centralized services, but in this phase I see the compromise between an huge outreach and the practical tool that has became standard de facto. Soon or later will be published a personal policy in identity compartimentalisation
