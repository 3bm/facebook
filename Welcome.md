# Welcome

This project, facebook.tracking.exposed, has the ambition to make algorithms accountable.
We have to think on it as a social and political achievement, not just as a technical challenge.

# Open data approach 

Every line of code we use for the project will be published in the organisation repository https://github.com/tracking-exposed/
Every data we collect has to be public, this will force ourself in a **transparency by default** and **privacy by default**

# Distribution

Considering that scape data from a propertaty platform has been forbidden to do profit, the distribution has to be intended as
declaration of will: **we are not collecting the data to make of these a profitable asset**

Considering that centralisation is a main issue we want address, distribution has to be intended as political statement: "the network is in charge,
whenever some of our analysis, politics, communication will not fit in the supporters vision, they might use the same data we are using to express their analysis, politics, visions"

# Resources

Distributed the effort in analysis, data collection, data storage is a mandatory effort because we lack of resources for that.
If resources are found, we can re-think this approach, but the points written in 'distribution' have to be respected

# Strategy in 6-12 months

The browser extension will supports more platforms in the next months and years, and other technologies that at the end of the day aim to:

  * Enable the supporters in cooperating with tracking.exposed data collection, more supporter and stronger is the network, unify these platform in a single extension is the core of the deploy strategy
  * the extension is intended for users that might not know anything about profiling and personalisation algorithm, they are 
  * Provide informations that social networks and other corportations can't, or might not want, give to the user. 
  * Make clear for the users what's happen in the massive survellaince busines model called advertising and profiling
  * Offer them the best solutions considering the technical limit we might face and legal risk I'm (Claudio) OK to take
 
# domain name tracking.exposed

There are other sub-project under the tracking.exposed domain name, currently not yet deployed,
belonging to the larger goal to make third party trackers, mass profiles, more accountable and explain to the public some dynamics of this new power structure.

Persons involved in the single project has not to feel any link or responsability (if they don't),
team member involved in the project would be display in the project page.

The usage of the same domain name is part of a communication strategy that want use the first word of the domain as "subject" and "tracking.exposed" as complement+verb.

Considering what written in 'distribution', the hope is many websites using some of the data, offering their own visualisation, analysis, enhancement

# The ÃŸ beta phase

Since September 2016 till the end of November 2016 the project operated in alpha release, the beta phase want stabilize:

  * Message for the academic community, we need to offer reliable data usable by researcher, enabling them in new research on personalisation algorithms
  * Clarification for the supporters on the kind of data we are harvesting: **we do not collect information that are not already public** and this has to be cristal clear
  * Technical specification for developers and analyst around the world: we are building an infrastructure with some technical properties, on top of this, visualisation, apps and comments can be put on top.
